                                    <h5>Review:</h5>
                                    <div>
                                        <p>The story, which Marvel seems to have been building toward since our collective childhoods, revolves around the existence of six “infinity stones” created during the Big Bang and sent “whizzing across the universe.” (This information comes courtesy of Wong—played by, no, not a typo, Benedict Wong—the mystical sidekick of Dr. Stephen Strange. Try, along with Bruce, to keep up.)</p>
                                        <p>By far the Biggest of the Big Bads we have yet encountered, Thanos—a motion-capture performance from Josh Brolin—believes that if he can get all six stones and affix them to his “infinity gauntlet,” he will be able to destroy half of all life in the universe with a literal snap of his fingers. Why would he want to do this? Well, consider Thanos the most enthusiastic—and unfortunately, also the most super-powered—disciple of Thomas Robert Malthus, who argued that appetites would always outstrip resources, leaving humankind perpetually poor and famished. Malthus, as a cleric, offered this thesis as an argument for less “vice,” later marriages, and greater celibacy. Thanos, as an all-powerful giant purple space-maniac, arrives at an alternative argument for more intergalactic genocide. </p>
                                        <p>The writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and the co-directors, Anthony and Joe Russo (all four of whom also worked on the last two Captain America movies), take this gargantuan cast and bang them off one another like super-powered billiard balls, arranging and disassembling duos, trios, and quartets at will. Is it a coincidence that they enjoy pitting like against like to snarky effect? Surely not. One hunky blond Chris (Pratt’s Star-Lord) finds himself jealous of another (Hemsworth’s Thor), especially when he witnesses the depths of Drax’s man-crush. (“It’s like a pirate had a baby with an angel,” Drax marvels.) And one pompously goateed master of the universe (Downey’s Tony Stark) is sure to be annoyed by his near-doppelgänger (Cumberbatch’s Dr. Strange), even if the latter gets in perhaps the all-time best Marvel-DC dig of all time when he says, of Stark’s young project, Peter Parker: “What is he, your ward?”</p>
                                        <p>Credit is of course due to directors the Russo brothers for pulling together something of this scale and ambition with such clarity and confidence. Having Thanos driving the narrative helps. The Infinity Stones have always felt like McGuffins, and even if their use and provenance isn’t always all that obvious, they’re a simple ploy for ratcheting tension: the more of the coloured gems that Thanos shoves into his golden gauntlet, the worse things get for future of life on Earth (and other planets). Even if you haven’t entirely kept up with the whereabout of the stones to this point, you’ll fare just fine. The action scenes are also delivered with flair and crunch: and as ever, the best involve characters working in unison and combining their powers in special moves. Crucially, you can always tell what’s going on in big fight scenes, and you never lose sight of the characters.</p>
                                        <p>The stone-collecting can feel a tad repetitive, and certain plot threads are set in motion that won’t be resolved until the untitled Avengers 4 in 2019 (or maybe in the inbetween films, Ant-Man and the Wasp and Captain Marvel). But any complaints are small fry in a film this bold, ballsy, satisfying, and dramatic. For delivering on fan expectations that have snowballed during 10 years of the MCU – and doing so with wit, pace, and surprises aplenty.</p>
