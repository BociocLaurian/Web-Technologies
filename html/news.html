													Kevin Hart’s ‘The Upside’ Opens With $1.1 Million in Thursday Preview Showings
												</h2>
												&nbsp;<span></span>Posted on 9 January , 2019 <br><br>
												<p class="post_intro hidden-xs">
													Kevin Hart-Bryan Cranston’s comedy-drama “The Upside” has launched with a moderate $1.1 million at 2,460 North American sites in Thursday night preview showings.

                                                    Family adventure “A Dog’s Way Home” retrieved $535,000 for Thursday night previews starting at 5 p.m. in 2,657 locations. Entertainment Studios’ Keanu Reeves sci-fier “Replicas” opened with $200,100 at 1,630 venues on Thursday.

                                                   Warner Bros.’ tentpole “Aquaman” is expected to win its fourth consecutive weekend easily over the newcomers by earning another $15 million to $20 million. The Jason Momoa starrer has dominated at multiplexes and is nearing $1 billion in worldwide grosses, topping $270 million domestically and $700 million internationally.

                                                   Forecasts for Sony’s “A Dog’s Way Home” and STX-Lantern Entertainment’s “The Upside” have both been in the $10 million range, leaving both in a battle for second place along with holiday holdovers “Mary Poppins Returns,” “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” and “Bumblebee” and the second weekend of “Escape Room.”

                                                    The Thursday night number for “The Upside” is similar to the $1 million taken in previews last year by Warner’s “Game Night,” which debuted with a $17 million weekend. “The Upside,” based on the French hit “Les Intouchables,” stars Cranston as a quadriplegic billionaire who befriends a recently paroled convict (played by Hart) who’s hired to help him.

													"Brooklyn Nine-Nine" Hits Two-Year High in NBC Debut"
												</h2>
												&nbsp;<span></span>Posted on 5 January , 2019 <br><br>
												<p class="post_intro hidden-xs">
													The NBC premiere of Brooklyn Nine-Nine was a strong one, scoring the show's best ratings in two years.

													The Universal TV comedy, which relocated to sister network NBC after five seasons on Fox, scored a 1.2 rating among adults 18-49 Thursday. That's the best showing for Brooklyn Nine-Nine since Jan. 1, 2017, when it had an NFL-asssted 1.3 on Fox, and the best same-day rating for any NBC Thursday comedy this season.
													
													The Good Place (0.9) and Law & Order: SVU (0.8) each improved a little on their last outings, and The Titan Games (1.6) held up nicely in its second week, falling only 11 percent from the 1.8 for its series premiere.
													
													CBS' Big Bang Theory led the night across the board, drawing its biggest total audience (13.34 million) of the season and second-best 18-49 rating (2.4). Young Sheldon (11.95 million, 1.9) and Mom (9.43 million, 1.5) hit season highs in both measures, and new comedy Fam premiered with 7.34 million viewers and a 1.2, on par with Murphy Brown's premiere in the fall (7.5 million, 1.1). SWAT equaled last week's season-high 0.9 in the 18-49 demo.

															Charlie Brooker on ‘Bandersnatch’s’ Hidden Paths and Testing Netflix’s Limits
													 </h2>
													 &nbsp;<span></span>Posted on 2 January , 2019 <br><br>
													 <p class="post_intro hidden-xs">
															here’s a road less taken in art as well as life, it seems. Although “Bandersnatch” offered viewers an interactive experience in its tale of a talented but tormented young video-game programmer, some story pathways wound up being trodden much less frequently, while a few others remained hidden or completely inaccessible, “Black Mirror” creator Charlie Brooker says.

															About 250 different segments were produced for “Bandersnatch,” which debuted worldwide on Netflix on Dec. 28. Brooker says that, during the editing process, the producers realized that some sections would be impossible to get to; no combination of choices could actually lead viewers there. In other cases, a viewer would have to go back and repeat a choice in order to get to an alternate sequence of events, which meant that some branches of the story were seen a lot less.
															
															It’s all part of the learning process of producing such an experimental and technically challenging show. Brooker and “Black Mirror” co-creator Annabel Jones said Netflix wanted to see what its platform could do with “Bandersnatch.”
															
															“One of the things they sort of wanted us to do was test the limits of what they could do because it’s a good experimental test case,” Brooker said. “Quite often we’d say, ‘Is this possible?’ They’d never say no. They’d say, ‘Maybe, let’s try and find out.’ Nine times out of 10, they would then work out a way in which it could happen.”

												<h2>
													‘Replicas’ Review: Keanu Reeves’ Awful Cloning Thriller Is a Hilarious Mess

												</h2>
												&nbsp;<span></span> 31 December , 2018 <br><br>
												<p class="post_intro hidden-xs">
														Frankensteined together from the stiff corpses of a dozen smarter movies, “Replicas” is a cloning thriller so carelessly stupid that it often feels like a mad science experiment gone wrong. In fact, the film is such an awkward chimera of stolen ideas that the premise alone violates the basic laws of screenwriting, and probably also those of nature itself.

														William Foster (Keanu Reeves, in a lifeless performance that’s silently praying for VOD) is the top neuroscientist at Puerto Rico’s Bionyne research facility, where he’s inventing a way to download a human brain into a synthetic robot body. That’s a difficult task, and it’s made a whole lot harder by William’s impatient boss (the ever-reliable John Ortiz), who gets all kinds of huffy when he learns that his star employee may not achieve the greatest technological achievement in all of history — and effectively kill God — in time for the company’s next earnings report.
														
														There’s reason for optimism when William’s assistant and human exposition device (a fidgety Thomas Middleditch) wheels in a new test subject who’s fresh from the morgue, but everything goes haywire after the android body — a janky CGI robot that melds the generic character design of “I, Robot” with the FX quality of “The Lawnmower Man” — violently rejects the dead man’s consciousness. But all of this business is really just a backdrop for the real plot, which kicks off when William accidentally steers his car off the road during a sudden island storm, killing his wife (Alice Eve) and their three kids in the process (don’t expect any references to Hurricane Maria, as “Replicas” was shot all the way back in 2016).

												<h2>
													 ‘If Beale Street Could Talk’: Why Black Love Is a Revolutionary Act — Opinion
												</h2>
												&nbsp;<span></span>Posted on 28 December , 2018 <br><br>
												<p class="post_intro hidden-xs">
														When people of color consider their history of revolution, images may come to mind of Toussaint Louverture defeating French colonialists; of Nat Turner, musket in hand, making his way across the Virginia countryside; of Martin Luther King Jr. speaking of dreams; of Malcolm X offering the choice of the ballot or the bullet; and of the Black Panther Party, clad in leather jackets and berets, standing firmly against the Oakland PD. But all these stories begin with the first true revolution anyone will face in their lives: the revolution of being one’s self. It is only by coming into full self-actualization that a man or woman finds the strength to stand to their full height, shed their chains, raise their voice, and begin the walk to freedom for themselves, their families, and their communities.

														A knower of self, James Baldwin, wrote the 1974 novel “If Beale Street Could Talk.” In it, the young African-American protagonists Fonny and Tish engage in the revolutionary act of self-discovery and in the process find not only themselves but also love.

														“Beale Street” is filled with the ups and downs, laughter and tears that come with being black in America. The book’s rich narrative of injustice invokes overwhelming emotions, as the language and imagery jump off the page. Barry Jenkins, Oscar-winning writer and director of the Best Picture Academy Award winner “Moonlight,” has masterfully shepherded Baldwin’’s brilliance onto the screen with his new movie “If Beale Street Could Talk.”

														Why ‘Hereditary’ Director Ari Aster Turned to Horror For His First Feature
												  </h2>
												  &nbsp;<span></span>Posted on 25 December , 2018 <br><br>
												  <p class="post_intro hidden-xs">
														When it came time to make his feature directorial debut, filmmaker Ari Aster knew that he wanted to make a film that took suffering seriously, to make something that served as a meditation on grief. Specifically, he wanted to examine how that type of trauma can have a corrosive effect on the entire family unit. The problem for Aster was that, while there are plenty of American films about the messy side of loss, in many of those features, characters ultimately end up stronger, their familial bonds tighter, for having navigated their way through adversity.

														That’s not what he wanted to make, however.

														“There’s nothing inherently false about that, we need hope to get out of bed in the morning, but there are some people who don’t recover from certain blows – sometimes people go down with the people that they are closest to,” said Aster, when he was a guest on IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “I wanted to make a film about that, but if I did make that as a bleak drama that ends on something of a hopeless note, first good luck finding the financing – and then if I do find the financing, I’m not going to have the resources that I had for this film – but then good luck finding an audience for it.”

															‘Burning’ Tops Asian Film Awards Nominations
													  </h2>
													  &nbsp;<span></span>Posted on 22 December , 2018 <br><br>
													  <p class="post_intro hidden-xs">
														
															Lee Chang-dong’s smoldering drama “Burning” picked up the largest number of nominations Friday for the 2019 edition of the Asian Film Awards. The Korean adaptation of a Japanese short story was nominated in eight categories, including best film.

															Other best film nominees were Pema Tseden’s “Jinpa,” Wen Muye’s “Dying to Survive,” Rajkumar Hirani’s “Sanju,” and Hirokazu Kore-eda’s “Shoplifters.”
															
															The nominations were announced in Hong Kong on Friday afternoon. The prize ceremony will be held in Hong Kong on Sunday, March 17.
															
															“Shoplifters,” “Sanju,” and Zhang Yimou’s “Shadow” ranked narrowly behind “Burning” with six nominations each. Hong Kong crime thriller “Project Gutenberg” earned five nods, while “Jinpa” and “Dying to Survive” both received four.
															
															While “Burning” and “Shoplifters” are both among the front-runners, as they have been at festivals and award events through the year, the AFA nominations rank them differently.
															
															“Shoplifters” won the Palme d’Or in Cannes, where both films premiered. It also won the top film prize at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards in November.
															
															Another curiosity is the fate of “Shadow.” At the Golden Horse awards in Taiwan, the highly stylized martial-arts drama picked up the most nominations and went home with the most prizes – four – including one for Zhang as best director. The AFAs omitted it from all performance categories, but put it in six technical awards races. It will compete against “Operation Red Sea,” the biggest Asian film of last year at the box office, which, similarly, received nominations only in technical categories.
